Simple Android app to add users and view the user information. Made for OOP course by LUT through FiTech

Utilizes various simple functionality from the Android Studio to build a simplistic UI that allows following:
1) Add Text (first and last name)
2) Add email
3) Select icon from a dropdown menu
4) Select a property from a radio group

These can then be saved to a storage class which implements a singleton design pattern.

This information can then be viewed in a separate window, which utilizes a scrollable recycler view.
